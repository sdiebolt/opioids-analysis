# Opioid-Induced Inter-regional Dysconnectivity Correlates with Analgesia in Awake Mouse Brains

This repository contains the Python package and Jupyter notebooks for analysis and
visualization of the Opioids dataset, from the article "Opioid-Induced Inter-regional
Dysconnectivity Correlates with Analgesia in Awake Mouse Brains".

## Abstract

> The µ-opioid receptor (MOP) is crucial for both the therapeutic and addictive
> effects of opioids. Using a multimodal experimental approach, here we
> combined awake functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging with behavioral and
> molecular assessments, to examine opioid-induced changes in brain activation
> and functional connectivity (FC). Morphine, fentanyl, and methadone induce
> significant dose- and time-dependent reorganization of brain perfusion,
> oscillations and FC in awake mice. Notably, opioids induce a transient,
> region-specific hyperperfusion, followed by a consistent MOP-specific
> dysconnectivity marked by decreased FC of the somatosensory cortex to
> hippocampal and thalamic regions, alongside increased subcortical and
> intra-cortical FC. These FC changes temporally correlate with generalized
> brain MOP activation and analgesia, but not with hypermobility and
> respiratory depression, suggesting a reorganization of inter-regional FC as a
> key opioid effect.The µ-opioid receptor (MOP) plays a pivotal role in
> mediating both the therapeutic
